# CAT-demo
R-based simulation of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) using the catR package for a bachelors thesis on CAT

## What It Does
- Creates a 3PL item bank with 50 items
- Simulates a test-taker with a known ability
- Selects items adaptively based on the Maximum Fisher Information (MFI) method
- Simulates responses using a 3PL response model
- Updates the ability estimate after each item
- Stops after 20 items and reports final ability estimate
